# Levenshtein distance calculator

This is a java program that calculates the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between 2 words. This is part of my homework assignments from my algorithms classes at college to introduce us to problem-solvings that use [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming).

## Getting started

I used the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE to build this project but feel free to use any other IDE as you wish.  Anyway, you just have to run the main program located in the `Main.java`'s **Main** class.  I am a bit lazy for not documenting the code enough ðŸ˜´ but at least I hope that the code is self-explanatory.  Peace nerd! ðŸ¤“âœŒ
